# daily-planner

## Description

This webpage is created to help employees manage their time more effectively by allowing the user to input important events to an interactive daily planner. The webpage will keep track of the current time and update the color of the hour block accordingly to allow the employee to know where in their schedule they are at.

## Installation

No installation is required for this application. To visit the the webpage open your default browser and go to: https://barosa19.github.io/daily-planner/ . To get to the development environment go to:https://github.com/barosa19/daily-planner.git .

## Usage

This webpage is designed to show past events (with a grey background), present events (with a red background), and future events (with a green background). The user may input those events in the text area and save it to their local storage. Thus when they need to refer back to it the event will still be on their planner.
